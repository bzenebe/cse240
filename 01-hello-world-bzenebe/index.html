    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>My name is:</strong>
        *** Bersabeh Zenebe ***
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>My email address is:</strong>
        *** bzenebe@wustl.edu ***
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>I am taking this class because:</strong>
        *** I have a minor in compsci and I am interested in interaction design! I have some experience coding in the past for my senior Sam Fox capstone, but I want to develop my ability to build a website just as well as I can design one.  ***
