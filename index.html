    <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4134/4877329116_a3d3ae4236_b.jpg" alt="Image of Medhane Alem Cathedral">
    <p>It is an impressive, breath-taking masterpiece of church architecture and a ‘must to see' when visiting Addis Ababa. The Medhane Alem Cathedral is according to the history the second biggest of its kind on the Africa continent, the largest being apparently the “Basilique Notre-Dame de la Paix de Yamoussoukro” in the administrative capital of Côte d'Ivoire, also known as the “basilica of the bush”. The Medhane Alem Cathedral whose name means “Saviour of the World”, however, is said to be the largest in Ethiopia, and is an Orthodox Tewahedo Cathedral in Bole Sub City, near the international airport, and was reportedly inaugurated in the year 2005.</p>

  <p>A pulsating nightclub downstairs from Yoly Hotel, Club H2O kicks things off with a more sedate Happy Hour: 7pm to 10pm with live jazz to keep things down tempo. Things get going after that with live bands then DJ-spun tunes until close to dawn. Friday is African night – otherwise, the music is the usual Afro-Western mix.</p>

  <h3>National Museum of Ethiopia</h3>
  <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4599/39195502641_9b1b68a9e6_b.jpg" alt="Image of National Museum of Ethiopia">
  <p>The museum houses Ethiopia's artistic treasures. It contains many precious local archaeological finds such as the fossilized remains of early hominids, the most famous of which is "Lucy," the partial skeleton of a specimen of Australopithecus afarensis. Recently added to the basement gallery is a display on Selam, found between 2000 and 2004. This archaic fossil is estimated to date to 3.3 million years ago.</p>

  <p>In 1936, the concept of a museum was first introduced in Ethiopia when an exhibition was opened, displaying ceremonial costumes donated by the Solomonic dynasty and their close associates. The current NME grew from the establishment of the Institute of Archaeology, which was founded in 1958. The institute was founded to promote and facilitate the archaeological research mission in the northern part of Ethiopia by French archaeologists.</p>

  <p>Stone statue from Addi-Galamo, Tigray Region (dated 6th-5th century BCE), part of the National Museum's collection. The statue is inscribed with a phrase in South Arabian, "For God Grants a Child to Yamanat".
  The museum started its activities by exhibiting objects from these excavation missions. With the establishment of the Ethiopian Cultural Heritage Administration in 1976, the idea came up to open a National Museum, which was supported by the Government. The NME began to operate under the National Act which provides for the protection and preservation of antiquities, and has legislative authority governing all sites and monuments throughout the country of Ethiopia. </p>
